        <p>
            The air fryer's rapid air circulation yields pork chops that are crispy 
            on the outside, yet flavorful and juicy on the inside. What more could you 
            want in an easy pork chop recipe? This recipe should completely cook 
            medium-sized pork chops in about 10 minutes in an air fryer set to 380 degrees F. 
            Of course, since pork chops vary in thickness, it's best to test the temperature 
            before you dig in. An instant read food thermometer inserted into the thickest part 
            of the chop should read at least 145 degrees F.
